        "This Agreement (which hereby incorporates by reference any other provisions applicable to use of the Websites, including, but not limited to, any supplemental terms governing the use of certain specific material contained in the Websites and any operating rules for the Websites established by PayPossible) constitutes the entire agreement between you and PayPossible and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, promises and proposals, whether oral, written or electronic, between you and PayPossible with respect to the Websites and information, software, products and services associated with it. This Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of laws principles. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved."
